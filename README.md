# rockPaperScissors
Web app where one can play the Rock, Paper and Scissors. Built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Used Flowbite (Tailwind CSS) to design the UI. Using components helped making website responsive much easy. Javascript was used for DOM Manipulation. This project was practice work for my DOM Manipulation learning journey.
